# CMake 构建方式学习

1. 创建构建目录（推荐 out-of-source 构建）
mkdir build
cd build

2. 生成 Makefile 并配置项目
cmake ..

3. 编译项目
make

4. 运行生成的可执行文件
./myapp

# 原始构建方式

步骤1：编译 src/Calculator.cpp 为对象文件（.o）
g++ -Iinclude -std=c++17 -c src/Calculator.cpp -o Calculator.o

步骤2：编译 main.cpp 为对象文件
g++ -Iinclude -std=c++17 -c main.cpp -o main.o

步骤3：链接两个对象文件，生成可执行文件
g++ Calculator.o main.o -o myapp

# 使用 Bazel 官方安装脚本

Buildifier was not found; linting and formatting of Bazel files will not be available. Please download it from https://github.com/bazelbuild/buildtools/releases and install it on your system PATH or set its location in Settings.

curl -LO "https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/releases/download/6.5.0/bazel-6.5.0-installer-linux-x86_64.sh"
chmod +x bazel-6.5.0-installer-linux-x86_64.sh
./bazel-6.5.0-installer-linux-x86_64.sh --user


Bazel is now installed!

Make sure you have "/home/codespace/bin" in your path.

For bash completion, add the following line to your :
  source /home/codespace/.bazel/bin/bazel-complete.bash

For fish shell completion, link this file into your
/home/codespace/.config/fish/completions/ directory:
  ln -s /home/codespace/.bazel/bin/bazel.fish /home/codespace/.config/fish/completions/bazel.fish

See http://bazel.build/docs/getting-started.html to start a new project!

This showcases how to build a single file to create a runnable application.

This BUILD file shows that we want to build a C++ binary using the ```cc_binary``` rule provided by Bazel.
In the ```cc_binary``` rule, name of the binary is specified in ```name``` attribute (in this example, it's ```hello-world```), required source files to be built are provided in ```srcs``` attribute.

```
cc_binary(
    name = "hello-world",
    srcs = ["hello-world.cc"],
)
```

To build this example, use
```
bazel build //main:hello-world
```

If the build is successful, Bazel prints the output similar to
```
____Loading complete.  Analyzing...
____Found 1 target...
____Building...
Target //main:hello-world up-to-date:
  C:/tools/msys64/tmp/_bazel_woden/vqeu6v3v/execroot/__main__/bazel-out/msvc_x64-fastbuild/bin/main/hello-world.exe
____Elapsed time: 0,400s, Critical Path: 0,01s
```

In the run log above you can see where the executable was built so you can locate it and use it.

You can also get the output path with the bazel cquery command. For
example, the command below would print the path to the output file. This
is a useful technique for use in scripts, where you do not want to parse the
`bazel build` output.

```
bazel cquery --output=files //main:hello-world
```
